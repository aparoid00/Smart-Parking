# Smart-Parking
The software that will be used along our prototype for the smart Parking Meter

The following code is made on LabView, and its purpose is to analyze the data we receive from the sensors of our parking meter in order for the users to be able to see all the data they want about a specific space. For example, it will show if the space is occupied, the time left in the meter, and if the car is parked correctly.

Traffic enforcement (or the owners of the parking lot) will be able to also see if a person did not pay, or if they left with their car incorrectly parked.

We wish to enter the Global Urban Datafest in the category of Best Hardware Project, fow which we are uploading our code into GitHub
